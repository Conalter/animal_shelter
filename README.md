The brief for this project is as follows:

Record Store
The owner of a Animal Shelter wants an app which will help to keep track of the animals in the shelter. This is not an app that staff will see, but will be used to check to see how many animals there are and who has adopted them.

You should be able to add an animal, which would have an name and DoB as well as the species.

MVP:
Create, update and remove animals and owners.
Show an inventory page listing animals and owners.
